# Guitar Hero Live Controller Daemon

This application reads raw input data from iOS Guitar Hero Live controllers and maps it to virtual XInput controllers for easy use on Linux operating systems.

A SteamOS Decky plugin wrapper for this application can be found [here](https://github.com/GuitarHeroLive/ghlble-decky).
